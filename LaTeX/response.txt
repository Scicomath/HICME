We have modified the paper as requested by the reviewer:
1)	We added collision system and beam energy in the caption of Figure 4 and corresponding main body.
2)	We changed the marks in Figure 5 according to the reviewer’s request.
3)	The paper’s English has been modified in many places, the specific changes are as follows:
